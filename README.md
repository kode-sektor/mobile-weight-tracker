# Mobile-Weight-Tracker

This is an application to enable users track their weight over time. This application will act as the transformation of an existing UI/UX-centric XD prototype. And since the application is small-scale, only rendering for mobile view will be considered. 

## Languages & Deployment

The **Mobile Weight Tracker** would be React-powered. Data used for the application is light-weight and personal to the user, thus Firebase *should suffice*. 
App would be deployed on Netlify.
